#' Create tribal land flag

#' @description
#' Imports tribal lands under of the control of federally-recognized tribes, computes intersection with Census tracts, and flags
#' any tract where at least 25 percent of the geographyâ€™s land area is within federally-recognized tribal lands.  In final_data.R,
#' High-Poverty & Segregated is not assessed in tracts where the tribal land flag is raised.
